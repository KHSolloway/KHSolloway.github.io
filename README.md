# About Me
## My Interests
* **_Cooking_**  
> I really enjoy cooking and creating meals for my family and friends. My two best friends are my
> Instapot and my Sous Vide machine. Both machines have changed the way I cook by speeding up the process
> on those recipes that have long cook times. I utilize the **_Copy Me That_** app for housing my favorite
> recipes, creating menu plans and building shopping lists.

* **_Wedding Cakes_**  
> As a wedding cake designer, I spend a lot of time perusing Instagram for design ideas and inspiration.
> I love details, especially is French couture designs. In order to prevent myself from copying another cake designer, I look to
> textiles, nature, jewelry, architecture and other artistic mediums for inspiration and design ideas. One of my favorite
> techniques is painted buttercream. Here is a painted buttercream cake I made which is the inspiration for my company [logo](https://www.lovecakenc.com/?lightbox=dataItem-ljdinrh9):

* _**Dollhouse Miniatures**_  
> When I turned 50, I didn't buy a Ferari, I bought myself an old dusty dollhouse instead. I decided I needed a hobby
> and resorted to my childhood dream of having an amazing dollhouse. As I figure out how to accomplish various
> updates, such as adding a chimney, creating brick siding or adding wood flooring, I record my work as tutorials
> and upload them to YouTube, Instagram and Facebook.
> 
* _**Bible Study**_  
> As a Christian, I value Scripture and understanding it in its proper context. In the past two years or so, I have dedicated
> a lot of time to reading the writings of the Reformers, such as Martin Luther, and also a variety of 17th-18th century theologians
> who expound on reformed theology. I find that these earlier teachings offer greater, unadulterated biblical Truth versus
> the majority of modern day Christian teachers.

## My Favorite Websites
1. [The Pioneer Woman](https://thepioneerwoman.com)  
> This is a great resource for consistently **delicious** recipes.
>
2. [Love Cake](https://lovecakenc.com/)  
> This is my business website, which I created in [Wix](wix.com) for my homebased wedding cake business.
> This is how my interest in web design began, which I view as another creative outlet. I would really
> love to improve upon it, so I'm excited to learn more about web design and development at Wake Tech.
>
3. [Its The Little Things](https://www.instagram.com/itsthelittlethings_dollhouse/)  
> I have been working on a dollhouse renovation for the past two years. I work in 1:12 scale and
> create tutorials that I post on a dedicated Instagram account to document
> my _miniaturist journey_.
>
4. [Ligonier Ministries](https://www.ligonier.org/)  
> This has been a wonderful resource for Bible study. I am grateful for the teachings of
> RC Sproul - he has really impacted my spiritual life.
