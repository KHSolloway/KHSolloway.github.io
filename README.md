My name is Kristina Solloway. I currently homeschool two 8th grade boys, one is mine and the other is a friend of the family. I also have a homebased wedding cake business. I really enjoy working on my business website and decided to make it a career change. I’d like to finish my degree so I can either start an online business or go work for another company as a web designer.
